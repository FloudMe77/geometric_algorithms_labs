# Geometric algorythms labs 
## Description

This repository contains implementations of algorithms covered in the Geometric Algorithms course at AGH University of Krakow. It emphasizes fundamental geometric algorithms and data structures.

Laboratory materials, such as template notebooks, a visualizer, and tests, are provided by the [_BIT Scientific Group_](https://github.com/aghbit/Algorytmy-Geometryczne).
